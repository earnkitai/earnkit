# Architecture Guide

## Core terminology

- **Program**: a live builder program run by someone else (hackathon, grant, bounty). Has a
  reward, a deadline, rules, and submission requirements. Curated by hand in `programs/*.json`.
- **existing_work / chains / starts_at**: per-program facts match_projects uses to match a
  builder's public repos (`allowed` / `new_work_only` / `unknown`).
- **setup / each_time**: what only the builder can do (one-time vs every entry); everything else
  is the agent's job. list_programs turns this into short "Me / You" lines on the server.
- **Track**: a category inside a program with its own requirements.
- **Starter**: an optional idea to start quickly. Max 1 per track, or 2 when there are no tracks.
  Which starter a builder used is never tracked.
- **Installation**: one anonymous agent connection. Identified only by a token hash.
- **Project / submission**: recorded after the agent submitted to the program's own site.

EarnKit does not build, evaluate, host, or pay. The agent uses its own tools for that.

## Apps at a glance

- `apps/frontend`: Next.js. Landing page, public activity section, the agent API, and all
  EarnKit logic (`lib/earnkit/`). Postgres via `DATABASE_URL`.
  It also hosts the EarnKit MCP server at `/mcp` and its anonymous OAuth (`/oauth/*`,
  `/.well-known/*`). There is no separate MCP package: every client connects to the URL.

## Data flow

```
agent (Grok, Muse, Claude, Cursor…) ──HTTPS──> /mcp
  first connect: 401 + WWW-Authenticate -> /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp
    -> /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server -> POST /oauth/register
    -> GET /oauth/authorize (approves instantly, no account) -> POST /oauth/token
    -> token = installation row; the client stores the token
  then: Bearer token -> /mcp -> lib/earnkit/mcp.ts -> lib/earnkit/tools.ts -> Postgres
stdio-only clients: npx mcp-remote https://earnkit.com/mcp
Claude Code ──> programs/<slug>.json ──push to main──> deploy: pnpm programs:sync ──> Postgres
```

## Separation of concerns

- Business logic lives only in `apps/frontend/lib/earnkit/`. Routes, scripts, and the page call it.
- match_projects reads only public GitHub data with one server-side token; nothing about the
  builder is stored. Verdicts are hints from code (chain IDs/RPC hosts, commit dates, repo
  homepage); anything unconfirmed is labeled "check".
- `prepareSubmission` is pure (no DB) and never invents values. It reports what is filled,
  what is missing, and whether the agent drafts it (`from: project`) or asks the builder
  (`from: builder`).
- OAuth is stateless: client ids and codes are HMAC-signed with `EARNKIT_AUTH_SECRET`; the
  access token is derived from the code, so a replayed code can't create a second installation.
  Rotating the secret invalidates unused codes and client ids, not issued tokens.
- Program files in git are the source of truth for programs/tracks/starters. Every deploy syncs
  them to the database (upsert replaces all three). Programs drop out of list_programs
  automatically after ends_at; there is no scheduled re-check.
- No auth beyond the installation token. Anyone can get one (by design), so the agent count
  can be inflated by someone scripting the sign-in flow.
